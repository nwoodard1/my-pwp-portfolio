## Milestone 1 Feedback
* Very cool that you are already adding CSS to your project.
* You did a good job of explaining the problem that the Business Owner is experiencing and his frustrations but try to relate that to the goals that your website will help him accomplish. How do his needs specifically relate to you? Does he not have time to look at resumes, or is he searching for a specific skill and wants to see it in action first?
* In order to avoid the horizontal scroll bar try targeting your image in CSS, a good way to start would be setting the max midth. If you have any questions about that just come and ask.
* Also pay attention to your opening and closing tags, use the style guide from the bootcampcoders site and you can also run your code through the W3C markup Validator.
* Overall very good work, I appreciate the initiative of going above and beyond with adding some CSS.
